                              Apart from high specialty areas such as Cardiac, Cardio Thoracic and Neuro-surgery, surgeons at Ruby Hospital also undertake a variety of relatively minor but popular repair work of the body like appendix removal surgery and thyroid surgery. In many cases patients can be released after a few hours on a day-care basis surgeries. At the other end of the spectrum, there are emergency surgical cases for patients in intensive care or coming through the Emergency Department.

                          <h1>Appendix Removal (Appendectomy)</h1>
                      <div class="tp">
                        <p>
                          An appendectomy is a surgery to remove the appendix when it is infected. This condition is called appendicitis. Appendectomy is a common emergency surgery. The appendix is a long narrow tube (a few inches in length) that attaches to the first part of the colon. It is usually located in the lower right quadrant of the abdominal cavity. There are two types of surgery to remove the appendix. The standard method is an open appendectomy and a less invasive method is laparoscopic appendectomy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <b>Open appendectomy -</b> A cut or incision about 2 to 4 inches long is made in the lower right-hand side of the belly or abdomen. The appendix is taken out through the incision.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Laparoscopic appendectomy -</b> This method is less invasive. That means it is done without a large incision. Surgeons operate through 3 small incisions (each ¼ to ½ inch). A long, thin tube called a laparoscope is put into one of the incisions. It has a tiny video camera and surgical tools. The surgeon looks at a TV monitor to see inside the abdomen and guide the tools. The appendix is removed through one of the incisions. In some cases, one of the small openings may be lengthened to complete the procedure.</p>
                        <h3>Advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy</h3>
                        <p>Results may vary depending upon the type of procedure and patient’s overall condition. Common advantages are:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Less post-operative pain</li><br>
                          <li>Faster recovery and return to normal activity</li><br>
                          <li>Shorter hospital stay</li><br>
                          <li>Less post-operative complications</li><br>
                          <li>Minimally sized incisions/scars</li><br>
                          <li>In most cases, patients can be discharged within 24 to 36 hours.</li><br>

                      <h1>Cholesystectomy (Gall Bladder)</h1>
                      <div class="tp">
                        <p>Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. The operation is done to remove the gallbladder due to gallstones causing pain or infection. <br><br>
                          There are two main ways of removing a gallbladder:</p>
                         <p><b>Laparoscopic (keyhole) cholecystectomy -</b> Several small cuts (incisions) are made in the abdomen and fine surgical instruments are used to access and remove the gallbladder. During the surgery, a small incision (about 2 to 3cm) is made by the belly button and 2 or 3 smaller incisions (about 1cm or less) are made on the right side of the abdomen. A small tube is inserted into one of the incisions and carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the abdomen, inflating it to make it easier for the surgeon to access the gallbladder. A laparoscope (a long, thin telescope with a light and camera at the end) is inserted through the larger incision, which allows the surgeon to see inside the abdomen on a monitor. Special surgical instruments are inserted through the other incisions and are used to remove the gallbladder. The gas is released from the abdomen, and the incisions are closed with sutures, surgical clips or glue. One can usually go home later the same day.</p>
                         <p><b>Open cholecystectomy -</b> A single larger incision is made in the abdomen to access and remove the gallbladder. The surgeon makes an incision approximately 6 inches long in the upper right side of the abdomen and cuts through the fat and muscle to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is removed, and any ducts are clamped off. The site is stapled or sutured closed. A small drain may be placed going from the inside to the outside of the abdomen. The drain is usually removed in the hospital.</p>
                        <h3>Non surgical treatment :</h3>
                        <p>Results may vary depending upon the type of procedure and patient’s overall condition. Common advantages are:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Thinning Bile with Acid Pills can dissolve gallstones</li><br>
                          <li>Small gallstones can be broken apart with Shock Waves</li><br>
                          <li>Endoscopic drainage follows the gallbladder’s natural path</li><br>
                          <li>Percutaneous Cholecystostomy is best for seriously ill patients</li><br>
                          <li>Transmural Drainage decompresses a swollen gallbladder</li><br>
                          <li> Acute Cholecystostomy, an ultrasound-guided drainage procedure</li><br>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
                      <h1>Spleenectomy</h1>
                      <div class="tp">
                        <p>
                          Splenectomies can be performed as laparoscopic surgeries if the spleen is not too enlarged. In a laparoscopic splenectomy, the surgeon makes just a few small cuts in the abdomen. In this technique, a tube is inserted into the abdomen and the space is inflated with carbon dioxide. The surgeon places other tubes into the abdomen through other small holes, allowing the placement of instruments. The spleen is cut free of all connections, put inside a special bag, and pulled through one of the largest holes in the abdomen. This type of surgery is minimally invasive and has a quicker and less painful recovery time than open surgery. 
                        </p>
                       <p><b>Open splenectomy -</b> A traditional open surgery involves making a cut down the center of the abdomen. The surgeon then moves aside other tissues to remove the spleen. The incision is then closed with stitches. Open surgery is preferred if there is scar tissue from other surgeries or if the spleen has been ruptured.</p>
                       <h3>Advantages of laparoscopic splenectomy :</h3>
                       <p>Individual results may vary depending on the overall condition and health but the usual advantages are the following :</p>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Less postoperative pain</li><br>
                         <li>Shorter hospital stay</li><br>
                         <li>Faster return to a regular, solid food diet</li><br>
                         <li>Quicker return to normal activities</li><br>
                         <li>Better cosmetic results</li><br>
                         <li>Fewer incisional hernias</li><br>
                       </ul>
                      </div>
                      <h1>Hernia Repair</h1>
                      <div class="tp">
                        <p>A hernia occurs when fatty tissue or an organ pushes through a weak place in the surrounding connective tissue or muscle wall. Hernias usually don’t get better on their own. They tend to get bigger. In rare cases, they can lead to life-threatening complications. Hernia repair surgery or herniorrhaphy involves returning the displaced tissues to their proper position. A hernia is usually treated with surgery. The three main types of hernia surgery are open repair, laparoscopic (minimally invasive) repair, and robotic repair. </p>
                        <p><b>Open surgery -</b> It is done under local or general anaesthetic. An incision usually around 2.5 to 3 inches is made to the skin near the hernia and the surgeon pushes the hernia back into the abdomen. The incision is then either stitched closed or much more commonly a mesh is placed over the hole and fixed using fine stitches. The mesh acts like a scaffold and the tissue will regrow through the mesh to reinforce the weakened area without putting tension on the surrounding tissues.</p>
                        <p><b>Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery -</b> It is done under general anaesthetic, several smaller incisions are made to allow the surgeon to use a less invasive technique using various special instruments including a tiny telescopic camera to repair the hernia. A mesh may then be used to strengthen the abdominal wall. Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) hernia repair uses a laparoscope, a thin, telescope-like instrument that is inserted through a small incision at the umbilicus (belly button). This procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia, so before the surgery, one has to have an evaluation of the general state of health, including a history, physical exam and an electrocardiogram (EKG). The laparoscope is connected to a tiny video camera, that projects an "inside view" of the body onto television screens in the operating room. The abdomen is inflated with a harmless gas (carbon dioxide), which creates space and allows the doctor to view the internal structures. The peritoneum (the inner lining of the abdomen) is cut to expose the weakness in the abdominal wall. Mesh is then placed on the inside to cover the defects in the abdominal wall and strengthen the tissue. After the procedure is completed, the small abdominal incisions are closed with a stitch or two or with surgical tape. Within a few months, the incisions are barely visible.</p>
                        <h3>The most frequently seen types of hernia include the following :</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Inguinal hernias :</b> The most common hernia and seen more in men. It causes a bulge in the groin. The inguinal hernia appears through the inguinal canal, a narrow passage through which blood vessels pass through in the abdominal wall and, may reach the scrotum.</li><br>
                          <li><b>Femoral hernias :</b> It also causes a bulge in the groin, relatively uncommon and seen more in women. The femoral hernia happens at the hole in the abdominal wall where the femoral artery and vein pass from the abdomen into the leg.</li><br>
                          <li><b>Hiatus hernias :</b> They occur in the upper chest area when part of the stomach pushes up into the chest by squeezing through a gap in the diaphragm called the hiatus.</li><br>
                          <li><b>Umbilical / periumbilical hernias –</b> These occur at the umbilicus, a natural weakness in the abdominal wall, when fatty tissue or a part of the bowel pokes through the abdomen near the naval.</li><br>
                          <li><b>Incisional hernia –</b> They occur through a scar from past abdominal surgery as tissue pokes through the weak healed site in the abdominal wall.  </li><br>
                          <li><b>Reducible hernia –</b> When the hernia can be pushed back into the opening it came through.  </li><br>
                          <li><b>Irreducible or incarcerated hernia –</b> When the organ or abdominal tissues have filled the hernia sac, and it cannot be pushed back through the hole it came through.  </li><br>
                          <li><b>Strangulated hernia –</b> When part of an organ or tissue becomes stuck inside the hernia with its blood supply often cut off.  </li><br>

                      <h1>Thyroid Surgery </h1>
                      <div class="tp">
                        <p>The thyroid is a small gland shaped like a butterfly. It is located in the lower front part of the neck, just below the voice box. The thyroid produces hormones that the blood carries to every tissue in the body. It helps regulate metabolism — the process by which the body turns food into energy. It also plays a role in keeping the organs functioning properly and helping the body conserve heat. </p>
                        <p>The most common reason for thyroid surgery is the presence of nodules or tumors on the thyroid gland. Most nodules are benign, but some can be cancerous or precancerous. Even benign nodules can cause problems if they grow large enough to obstruct the throat, or if they stimulate the thyroid to overproduce hormones (a condition called hyperthyroidism).</p>
                        <p>Another reason for thyroid surgery is the swelling or enlargement of the thyroid gland. This is referred to as a goiter. Like large nodules, goiters can block the throat and interfere with eating, speaking, and breathing.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Thyroid Surgery :</h3>
                        <p>There are several different types of thyroid surgery. The most common are lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy, and total thyroidectomy.</p>
                        <p><b>Lobectomy -</b> Sometimes a nodule, inflammation, or swelling affects only half of the thyroid gland. When this happens, the doctor will remove only one of the two lobes. The part left behind should retain some or all of its function. It is sometimes called a "diagnostic lobectomy" because the preoperative diagnosis may be uncertain and part of the reason for the operation is to make a diagnosis of cancer or no cancer. A diagnostic lobectomy may or may not involve a frozen section. A frozen section is biopsy of the nodule that is taken during the operation while the patient is still under anesthesia.</p>
                        <p><b>Subtotal Thyroidectomy -</b> A subtotal thyroidectomy removes the thyroid gland but leaves behind a small amount of thyroid tissue. This preserves some thyroid function. It may be done for benign thyroid conditions that affect both thyroid lobes, such as large goiter or Graves’ disease, or it may be done for cancer. A subtotal thyroidectomy means that a very small amount of benign thyroid tissue is left behind. Thyroid tissue may be intentionally left behind in areas around important structures, such as the nerves that control the voice, swallowing, and breathing, or the parathyroid glands. Many individuals who undergo this type of surgery develop hypothyroidism, a condition that occurs when the thyroid doesn’t produce enough hormones. This is easily treated with daily hormone supplements.</p>
                        <p><b>Total Thyroidectomy -</b> A total thyroidectomy removes the entire thyroid and the thyroid tissue. It may be done years later or it may be done soon after a lobectomy This surgery is appropriate when nodules, swelling, or inflammation affect the entire thyroid gland, or when cancer is present. All patients who undergo a completion thyroidectomy will need to be on life-long thyroid hormone replacement after surgery.</p>
                        <p><b>Minimally Invasive Thyroid Surgery -</b> The typical incision made for thyroid surgery is known as a "collar incision" in which a large incision (around 5 to 6 inches) is made stretching from one side of the neck to the other just above the collar bone. Minimally invasive thyroid surgery refers to certain types of surgery in which the thyroid is removed through very small incisions (an inch to an inch and a half in length) using special techniques. In addition to using very small incisions, the surgeons "hide" the incision in a natural skin crease which acts like camouflage. Most people will not be able to notice the incision once the redness fades away.</p>
